# Pacman AI Solver (written in C)
Assignment 2 for COMP20003 Semester 2, 2019. Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm for an AI Pac-man solver using C.

The objective is to eat all food while avoiding ghosts. Pacman can also eat fruits which  allows it to eat the ghosts for a fixed period of time to earn bonus points. Once Pacman successfully eats all the food, it will level up. When Pacman has lost all lives, the game is over.
